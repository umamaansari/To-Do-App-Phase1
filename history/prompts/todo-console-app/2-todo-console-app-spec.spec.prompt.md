This is a Todo In-Memory Python Console App (Phase 1), focused on basic functionality. I'll break it down step by step, covering objectives, requirements, features, technology stack, development approach, potential challenges, best practices, and how it fits into a hackathon context. This analysis will help ensure the project is well-structured, feasible, and aligned with your goals. 1. Overview and Objective Project Description: This is a command-line interface (CLI) Todo application that manages tasks entirely in memory (no database or file persistence). It's the "basic level" phase, serving as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a Todo app. The app allows users to interact via console commands to handle simple task management. Objective: Build a functional foundation that demonstrates core Todo app features. It's quick to implement, focusing on essential operations without advanced features like persistence, user authentication, or GUI. This makes it ideal for a hackathon, where time is limited, and the emphasis is on clean, working code. Scope: Limited to in-memory storage (e.g., using a list or dictionary in Python). No data is saved after the app exits, which keeps it simple but functional for demo purposes. Hackathon Fit: Perfect for a short sprint (e.g., 24-48 hours). It showcases Python skills, spec-driven development, and clean architecture. You can extend it in future phases (e.g., adding file/DB persistence). 2. Requirements Breakdown Core Features (Basic Level): Add Task: Create a new todo item with a title and description. Assign a unique ID automatically (e.g., incremental integer). Store in memory. Delete Task: Remove a task by its ID. Handle cases like invalid ID gracefully (e.g., error message). Update Task: Modify details of an existing task (title, description) by ID. Again, validate ID. View Task List: Display all tasks with details like ID, title, description, and status (e.g., "Pending" or "Complete"). Use status indicators (e.g., [X] for complete, [ ] for pending). Mark as Complete/Incomplete: Toggle the completion status of a task by ID. This should update the in-memory storage and reflect in views. Development Approach: Spec-Driven Development: Use Spec-Kit Plus (likely a tool/framework for writing and evolving specifications, possibly AI-assisted). This involves creating specs first, then implementing code based on them. Mention of "Claude code" suggests using AI like Claude for generating code from specs. Qwen Integration: You mentioned "qwen ka use krta hua" – assuming this refers to Qwen (an AI model from Alibaba, similar to GPT). It could be used for generating specs, code, or prompts in conjunction with Spec-Kit Plus. For example, Qwen might help refine the constitution prompt or generate code snippets. Clean Code Principles: Follow PEP 8 style, meaningful variable names, modular functions/classes, error handling, and separation of concerns (e.g., separate modules for UI, logic, and data). Proper Python Project Structure: Use a standard layout like: src/ for source code (e.g., main.py, todo_manager.py). spec_history/ for versioned spec files (e.g., JSON/YAML specs generated by Spec-Kit). constitution.md or similar as the root spec document. README.md for setup and usage. Technology Stack: Python 3.13+: Latest features like improved type hints, performance optimizations. Uv: A fast Python package manager (alternative to pip/venv). Use it for dependency management (e.g., uv venv, uv pip install spec-kit). Spec-Kit Plus: Assumed to be a spec management tool. It enforces spec-driven dev by generating code/tests from specs. No other dependencies mentioned, so keep it minimal (e.g., no external libs like Click for CLI unless needed). Deliverables: GitHub Repository: Public/private repo with commits showing progression (specs first, then code). Constitution File: A root prompt/spec file that defines the entire project. This is what you're asking for – likely a Markdown or text file used as input for Spec-Kit/Qwen to generate detailed specs. Spec History Folder: Store iterative spec files (e.g., v1.spec, v2.spec) to track changes. /src Folder: Python code implementing the features. README.md: Instructions for setup (e.g., uv venv, run python src/main.py), usage examples, and demo commands. Working Demo: Console app that runs loops for user input (e.g., "add", "list", "quit") and handles all features. 3. Potential Challenges and Solutions In-Memory Storage: Simple (use a list of dicts: [{'id': 1, 'title': 'Task', 'desc': 'Details', 'complete': False}]), but ensure IDs are unique and handled correctly. CLI User Experience: Make it intuitive with a menu or command-based input (e.g., using input() in a loop). Handle invalid inputs with try-except. Spec-Driven Workflow: Start with constitution prompt → Use Spec-Kit/Qwen to generate detailed specs → Implement code → Test against specs. Challenge: Ensuring specs evolve without breaking code. Solution: Version specs in history folder. Error Handling: Validate inputs (e.g., non-existent IDs, empty titles). Use clean messages. Testing: Manually test in console, or add simple unit tests if time allows (though not required). Hackathon Time Management: Specs: 20%, Code: 50%, Testing/Demo: 20%, Repo/Readme: 10%. Aim for 2-4 hours total for this phase. Edge Cases: Empty list on view, toggling complete multiple times, long descriptions (handle formatting). 4. Best Practices and Recommendations Modular Design: todo_manager.py: Class for managing tasks (add, delete, update, mark, get_all). main.py: CLI loop for user interaction. Clean Code: Use type hints (e.g., def add_task(title: str, desc: str) -> None), docstrings, and avoid global variables. Spec-Kit Plus Usage: Feed the constitution prompt to Spec-Kit/Qwen to auto-generate code skeletons or tests. Enhancements (If Time Allows): Color-coded status (using ANSI escapes), help command, quit gracefully. Why This Works for Hackathon: Demonstrates end-to-end skills (specs, code, repo). Easy to present: Run in terminal, show features live. Risks: Overcomplicating specs – keep constitution concise. If Qwen is for AI generation, ensure outputs are customized. This analysis covers the project holistically. It's straightforward, achievable, and sets a strong base for extensions. Constitution Prompt Below is a well-structured "constitution" prompt for your project. This can be saved as constitution.md or a text file in your repo. It's designed to be fed into Spec-Kit Plus and Qwen (or similar AI) for generating detailed specs, code, and tests. The prompt is comprehensive, self-contained, and follows spec-driven principles. It defines the project vision, requirements, and constraints to guide the development process. Project Constitution: Todo In-Memory Python Console App (Phase 1) Project Overview Build a basic command-line Todo application in Python that manages tasks in memory (no persistence). The app must implement core features for adding, deleting, updating, viewing, and marking tasks as complete. Use spec-driven development with Spec-Kit Plus to generate and evolve specifications. Integrate Qwen for refining specs or generating code snippets from this constitution. Follow clean code principles, Python best practices, and a modular structure. Objectives Create an MVP Todo app focused on essential functionality. Demonstrate spec-driven workflow: Start with this constitution, generate specs via Spec-Kit Plus/Qwen, implement code, and version specs in a history folder. Ensure the app is user-friendly in a console environment, with clear commands and error handling. Technology Stack Python: 3.13+ Package Manager: Uv (for virtual env and dependencies) Spec Tool: Spec-Kit Plus (for spec generation and validation) AI Assistance: Qwen (use for prompt-based spec refinement or code generation) No external libraries beyond basics (e.g., built-in modules only; avoid third-party CLI tools unless specified in evolved specs). Core Requirements and Features Implement the following basic-level features as the foundation: Add Task: Command: 'add <title> <description>' (or prompt for inputs). Create a new task with a unique auto-generated ID, title (string, required), description (string, optional), and initial status 'Pending' (complete: False). Store in an in-memory list or dict. Output: Confirmation message with ID. Delete Task: Command: 'delete <id>' Remove the task by ID if it exists. Handle invalid ID: Error message "Task not found." Output: Success message. Update Task: Command: 'update <id> <new_title> <new_description>' (or interactive prompts). Modify title and/or description of an existing task by ID. Handle invalid ID: Error message. Output: Updated task details. View Task List: Command: 'list' or 'view' Display all tasks in a formatted list, including: ID, Title, Description, Status (e.g., [X] Complete or [ ] Pending). If no tasks: Message "No tasks available." Sort by ID ascending. Mark as Complete/Incomplete: Command: 'mark <id>' Toggle the completion status (True/False). Handle invalid ID: Error message. Output: New status confirmation. Additional Constraints In-Memory Storage: Use a simple data structure (e.g., list of dicts: {'id': int, 'title': str, 'desc': str, 'complete': bool}). No file/DB saving. CLI Interface: Run in a loop with user input. Support commands like 'help' (list commands), 'quit' (exit). Use input() for interactions. Error Handling: Validate inputs (e.g., non-empty title, integer ID). Graceful exits on errors. Clean Code: PEP 8 compliant, type hints, docstrings, modular (e.g., separate class for TodoManager). Project Structure: /src: main.py (CLI entry), todo_manager.py (logic). spec_history/: Versioned spec files (e.g., v1.spec.json). README.md: Setup (uv venv, python src/main.py), usage examples. Spec-Driven Process Use this constitution as input to Spec-Kit Plus/Qwen to generate initial specs (e.g., detailed feature specs, test cases). Evolve specs iteratively: Version in spec_history. Generate code from specs using Qwen if needed, then manually refine. Validate implementation against specs. Deliverables and Success Criteria GitHub repo with all files. Working console app demoing all features. Specs cover 100% of features with examples. This constitution defines the immutable core of the project. Evolve specs from here without altering fundamentals. You can copy this prompt into your constitution file. Feed it to Spec-Kit Plus and Qwen to generate the first spec version, then proceed to code. If you need adjustments or help with the next steps (e.g., code snippets), let me know!1.2sExpert.txt format main banakrdo constitution ki propmtHere is the constitution prompt in plain .txt-friendly format (no extra markdown formatting, just clean text). You can copy-paste it directly into a file named constitution.txt or constitution.md (both will work). textProject Constitution: Todo In-Memory Python Console App (Phase 1) Project Overview Build a basic command-line Todo application in Python that manages tasks completely in memory (no file or database persistence in this phase). The application must support the 5 core features: Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark as Complete/Incomplete. Development must follow spec-driven approach using Spec-Kit Plus. Use Qwen (or similar) to help refine specifications or generate initial code skeletons from this constitution. Follow clean code principles and standard Python project structure. Main Objectives - Create a minimal viable Todo console app for hackathon demonstration - Show spec-driven development workflow: constitution → detailed specs → code implementation - Keep everything simple, fast to build, and easy to demo in terminal - No data should be saved after program exits (pure in-memory) Technology Stack - Python: 3.13 or newer - Package / environment manager: uv - Specification tool: Spec-Kit Plus - AI assistance: Qwen (for spec generation, refinement, code ideas) - External dependencies: none / minimal (only built-in modules preferred) Core Features - Must Implement Exactly These 1. Add Task - User can create new task with title (required) and description (optional) - Automatically assign unique incremental ID (starting from 1) - Initial status: not completed - Show confirmation with the assigned ID 2. Delete Task - Delete task by entering its ID - Show error message if ID does not exist - Show success message after deletion 3. Update Task - Update title and/or description of existing task by ID - Allow partial update (only title, only description, or both) - Show error if ID not found - Show updated task details after change 4. View / List Tasks - Show all current tasks in a readable format - Display for each task: ID, Title, Description, Status (Complete / Pending) - Use simple indicators e.g. [X] Completed [ ] Pending - If no tasks → show friendly message "No tasks yet." 5. Mark as Complete / Incomplete - Toggle completion status of a task by ID - One command should toggle (complete ↔ incomplete) - Show error if ID not found - Show new status after toggle Additional Must-Have Behaviors - Command-line interface runs in a loop - User types commands like: add, list, update, delete, mark, help, quit - Support simple 'help' command showing available commands - 'quit' or 'exit' should close the application gracefully - Handle invalid inputs gracefully (show error message, don't crash) - IDs must be integers and unique Data Structure Recommendation (in-memory only) - Use a list of dictionaries - Example task: {"id": 1, "title": "Buy groceries", "description": "Milk, eggs, bread", "completed": False} Project Structure (required) - src/ - main.py → CLI loop and user interaction - todo_manager.py → class or functions for task logic - spec_history/ → folder to save all generated .spec or .json specification versions - constitution.txt → this file - README.md → setup instructions + usage examples Spec-Driven Development Rules 1. Use this constitution as the root document 2. Feed this text to Spec-Kit Plus + Qwen to generate first detailed specification file 3. Save generated spec in spec_history/ (v1.spec, v2.spec, etc.) 4. Implement code based on the latest spec version 5. If requirements change slightly → create new spec version, do not break existing working features Success Criteria for Phase 1 - Application runs without crashing - All 5 features work correctly - Clean, readable console output - GitHub repo contains: - constitution file - spec history folder with at least 1-2 spec files - src folder with working code - README with: - How to install uv (if needed) - How to create virtual env and run the app - Example commands with screenshots or text samples This constitution is the single source of truth for Phase 1. Any major changes must update this file first. Keep Phase 1 simple — focus on working core + good spec process. You can save this exactly as-is into constitution.txt. Let me know if you want: shorter version version with example commands layout version already split for Spec-Kit sections or next step (e.g. sample spec v1 or main.py skeleton) Good luck with the hackathon! 🚀1.6sFastconstitution ki prompt hogyi ab tum mujha specify ki prompt likh krdoAb constitution ready hai, ab specify ki prompt likh deta hoon. Yeh prompt tum Spec-Kit Plus (specifyplus CLI) mein use kar sakte ho, specifically /specify command ke saath ya directly Qwen/Claude ko dekar initial detailed specification generate karwa sakte ho. Yeh prompt constitution se seedha build kiya gaya hai, aur isme project ka high-level intent, features, constraints, tech stack sab cover kiya hai taaki AI ek clean, structured spec file bana sake (jaise spec_history/001-todo-app.spec.md ya JSON format mein). Copy-paste kar ke specify.md ya initial-spec-prompt.txt bana lo, aur phir Spec-Kit Plus mein feed karo. textInitial Specification Prompt for Spec-Kit Plus /specify Project Name: Todo In-Memory Python Console App (Phase 1) High-Level Intent / What to Build: I want a simple, fast, command-line Todo list application written in pure Python. It should run entirely in memory (no files, no database, no persistence — data lost on exit). The app is for a hackathon MVP — focus on clean code, good UX in terminal, and demonstrating the 5 basic CRUD-like operations for tasks. Must-Have Features (Core Requirements — implement exactly these): 1. Add a new task - User provides: title (required, string), description (optional, string) - Auto-assign unique ID (start from 1, integer, incremental) - Default status: not completed (completed = False) - Show confirmation: "Task added with ID: X" 2. Delete a task - User provides: ID (integer) - If ID exists → remove it - If not → show clear error "Task with ID X not found" - Show success message after delete 3. Update a task - User provides: ID, new title (optional), new description (optional) - Update only provided fields (partial update allowed) - If ID not found → error message - Show updated task details 4. View/List all tasks - Command: list or view - Show numbered list with: - ID - Title - Description (truncate if too long, e.g., first 50 chars + ...) - Status: [X] Completed or [ ] Pending - If empty: "No tasks added yet." - Keep output clean and readable (use alignment or simple formatting) 5. Mark task as complete / incomplete - Command: mark <ID> - Toggle current status (completed ↔ not completed) - Show new status: "Task X marked as Completed" or "Pending" CLI Interface Requirements: - Run in an infinite loop until user quits - Accept simple text commands: add, list, update, delete, mark, help, quit - 'help' command → show list of all commands with short description + example usage - 'quit' or 'exit' → graceful exit - Handle bad input gracefully (e.g., wrong number of args, non-integer ID) → show helpful error, don't crash - Optional: interactive mode for add/update (ask title/desc one by one if no args given) Technical Constraints & Rules: - Python version: 3.13+ - Use uv for virtual environment and dependency management (but no external packages needed) - No third-party libraries (only built-in: sys, os, typing if needed) - Data storage: in-memory only → use list[dict] or dict[int, dict] Example task structure: {"id": 1, "title": "Study", "description": "Python SDD", "completed": False} - Follow clean code: - Separate concerns (CLI in main.py, logic in todo_manager.py or class TodoManager) - Use type hints where possible - Add docstrings to functions/classes - PEP 8 style - Error handling: try/except for ValueError on int conversion, KeyError for missing IDs - Output formatting: use print() with f-strings or simple tables via string formatting Project Structure to Generate / Follow: - src/ - main.py # CLI loop, command parsing - todo_manager.py # Task logic class or functions - spec_history/ # where this spec + future versions go - README.md # setup with uv venv, how to run, example commands - constitution.txt # already provided earlier Non-Negotiable Principles (from constitution): - Keep it minimal and fast to build (hackathon-friendly) - Focus on working core + readable console output - Specs are source of truth — code must match this spec exactly - No extra features in Phase 1 (no due dates, priorities, categories, colors, persistence) Generate full detailed specification including: - Acceptance criteria for each feature - Example user interactions / command flows - Edge cases to handle - Suggested class/function breakdown - Sample output formats After generating this spec, I will review/approve it, then move to /plan and /tasks. Kaise use karna hai (quick steps): Spec-Kit Plus install kar lo (agar nahi kiya): uv tool install specifyplus (ya pip install specifyplus) Project folder mein jaake initialize karo (agar constitution ke saath setup nahi kiya): specifyplus init . --ai qwen (ya claude, jo bhi use kar rahe ho) Phir is prompt ko chat/agent mein paste karke: /specify aur upar wala text daal do. Ya seedha Qwen/Claude ke chat mein daal ke bolo: "Generate a detailed spec file based on this prompt for my Todo app project using Spec-Kit Plus format." Yeh spec generate hone ke baad spec_history mein save kar dena (v1.spec.md ya similar). Agar spec generate hone ke baad changes chahiye ya plan/tasks phase ki prompt chahiye, to bata dena! Best of luck hackathon ke liye — yeh solid base ban jayega! 🚀1.7sFast50 sourcesab tum mujha specify ki propt likh kardoAb yeh lo specify ki dedicated prompt. Yeh prompt specifically /specify command ke liye banayi gayi hai Spec-Kit Plus (ya GitHub Spec Kit) mein. Tum isko directly Spec-Kit ke chat/agent mein paste kar sakte ho jab tum /specify type karo, ya agar CLI mode mein ho to is text ko input ke roop mein use karo. Yeh prompt constitution se evolve kiya gaya hai aur detailed, structured spec generate karne ke liye perfect hai. Isme acceptance criteria, examples, edge cases, architecture sab cover hai taaki AI ek solid spec file bana de (jaise spec_history mein .md ya .json). textSpecify this project using Spec-Driven Development principles. Project Title: Todo In-Memory Python Console App - Phase 1 Constitution Reference: Use the existing constitution.txt as the root source of truth (already provided in the project). Core Intent: Develop a minimal, in-memory Todo list CLI application in Python for hackathon MVP. It must support exactly 5 basic operations: Add, Delete, Update, View/List, Mark Complete/Incomplete. Everything is in-memory only — no persistence, no external files/DB in this phase. Emphasize clean, modular code, good terminal UX, error handling, and spec adherence. Detailed Feature Specifications: 1. Add Task Acceptance Criteria: - User can add task with title (mandatory) and description (optional). - Auto-generate unique sequential ID starting from 1. - New tasks default to completed=False. - Output: "Task added successfully! ID: <id>" - If title empty → error: "Title is required." Edge Cases: Empty description allowed, very long title/desc (handle gracefully), duplicate titles ok. 2. Delete Task Acceptance Criteria: - Command takes ID as argument. - If ID exists → remove and confirm "Task <id> deleted." - If not found → "Task with ID <id> not found." Edge Cases: Invalid/non-integer ID, delete last task, delete from empty list. 3. Update Task Acceptance Criteria: - Command takes ID + optional new title + optional new description. - Update only provided fields (partial updates supported). - If ID not found → error message. - Output updated task summary. Edge Cases: Update nothing (no change), update only one field, invalid ID. 4. View/List Tasks Acceptance Criteria: - Show all tasks in numbered/aligned format. - Columns/fields: ID | Status ([X]/[ ]) | Title | Description (truncate if >60 chars). - If no tasks: "No tasks added yet." - Sorted by ID ascending. Edge Cases: Empty list, many tasks (readable output), long descriptions. 5. Mark Task Acceptance Criteria: - Command: mark <id> - Toggle completed status. - Output: "Task <id> marked as [Completed/Pending]." - Invalid ID → error. Edge Cases: Toggle multiple times, mark non-existent. CLI Behavior: - Infinite loop with prompt (e.g., "> ") - Supported commands: add, list/view, update, delete, mark, help, quit/exit - help: List commands with brief description + 1 example each. - quit: Clean exit ("Goodbye!") - Parsing: Simple space-split, handle quotes if needed later (basic for now). - Errors: Catch ValueError (int conversion), KeyError (ID lookup), show user-friendly msg + continue loop. Architecture & Code Guidelines: - Use list[dict] for storage: {"id": int, "title": str, "description": str, "completed": bool} - Modular: - todo_manager.py → TodoManager class with methods: add_task, delete_task, update_task, get_all_tasks, toggle_complete, find_by_id (private) - main.py → CLI loop, command parser, user input handling - Type hints recommended (from typing import List, Dict, Optional) - Docstrings on class/methods - No external libs (built-in only) - PEP8 compliant, meaningful names Project Deliverables in Spec: - Full folder structure diagram - Key class/method signatures - Example command sessions (input/output) - List of edge cases & how handled - No new features beyond constitution Generate the specification in clear Markdown format with sections: - Overview - Features (one subsection per feature with AC, examples, edges) - CLI Commands & UX - Data Model - Architecture - Non-functional (performance, errors) - Next Steps (plan/tasks) Output only the final spec content — ready to save as v1-todo-spec.md in spec_history/ Kaise use karna: Agar tum Spec-Kit Plus CLI ya agent chat mein ho → /specify type karo → yeh pura prompt paste kar do. Ya agar direct Qwen/Claude use kar rahe ho → bolo: "Generate a detailed Spec-Kit specification for my Todo app using this prompt:" aur yeh text daal do. Spec generate hone ke baad review karo, approve karo, phir /plan aur /tasks phase mein ja sakte ho. Agar is spec ke baad plan prompt ya tasks prompt chahiye, ya generated spec ko refine karna ho, to bata dena.
